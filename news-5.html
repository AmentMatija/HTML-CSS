			<h2>UK's richest man eyes North Sea oil and gas fields</h2>
			<p class="description">Britain's richest man Jim Ratcliffe is hoping to extend his grip on the North Sea by buying oil and gas fields from US giant ConocoPhillips.</p>
			<p>Mr Ratcliffe's company Ineos and ConocoPhillips have both confirmed that they are in exclusive talks.Among the assets up for grabs is Conoco's 6.5% stake in the Clair field, west of Shetland.</p>
			<p>The field potentially has 7 billion barrels of oil in place, according to BP's chief executive Bob Dudley.</p>
			<p>BP recently bought a 16.5% stake in the Clair field from ConocoPhillips, giving the UK oil giant a total holding of 45.1%.</p>
			<p>Reports suggest that the assets ConocoPhillips is selling could be worth as much as $3bn (£2.3bn). They do not include the company's oil terminal in Teesside or its commercial trading group based in London.</p>
			<p>The billionaire, whose £21bn fortune makes him the UK's richest man according to the Sunday Times rich list, has traditionally invested in speciality chemicals businesses.</p>
			<p>Ineos owns the Grangemouth oil refinery site in Scotland which manufactures a range of petrochemicals that are used in a wide range of products including bottles, food packaging and in the pharmaceuticals industry.</p>
			<p>The Sunday Times reported that Ineos had put down a deposit in exchange for three months of exclusive talks with ConocoPhillips. Ineos declined to comment.</p>
